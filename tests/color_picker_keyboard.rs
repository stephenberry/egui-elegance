//! Keyboard operation of `ColorPicker`'s three continuous surfaces.
//!
//! The SV plane, hue strip, and alpha strip were pointer-only: focusable, so
//! `Tab` landed on them, but bound to no keys, so the arrows navigated straight
//! back off and a keyboard user could not pick a colour at all. These tests
//! drive each surface by key and assert the bound colour moves.
