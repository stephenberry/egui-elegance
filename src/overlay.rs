//! Shared internals for the overlay widgets: layering, modality, focus
//! lifecycle, and the chrome they both render.
//!
//! [`Modal`](crate::Modal) and [`Drawer`](crate::Drawer) both stack the same
//! two things over the app: a full-viewport backdrop that must swallow every
//! interaction behind it, and a content surface that must stay above that
//! backdrop. Getting this right in egui takes more care than it looks, so the
//! rules live here rather than being duplicated (and drifting) per widget.
//!
//! # The layer contract
//!
//! **One overlay is one [`Area`](egui::Area), at [`Order::Foreground`].** The
//! backdrop is painted and sensed *inside* that area rather than getting an
//! area of its own. A split across two orders (the obvious first design —
//! backdrop at [`Order::Middle`], content at [`Order::Foreground`]) leaves a
//! gap that any ordinary [`egui::Window`] slots straight into: the window
//! renders above the backdrop, so it keeps receiving clicks the overlay was
//! supposed to block, and clicking it raises it above the overlay's content.
//! Sharing one layer also makes the backdrop-below-content relationship
//! structural instead of something to re-assert every frame.
//!
//! **Pointer blocking is the backdrop's own doing.** It senses clicks across
//! the whole viewport, and egui routes a click to the topmost layer under the
//! cursor, so everything below the overlay's layer stops being reachable.
//!
//! That ordering needs no maintenance, because a window that cannot be clicked
//! never asks to be raised. Do *not* be tempted to re-assert it with a
//! per-frame `move_to_top`: egui applies that as a *stable sort* at the end of
//! the pass, lifting the layer above every layer that did not also ask. Popups,
//! menus and combo-box dropdowns are plain [`Order::Foreground`] areas, so an
//! overlay that re-raised itself each frame would sink any popup opened from
//! inside its own content.
//!
//! **Anything above [`Order::Foreground`] stays above.** Toasts and drag
//! ghosts live at [`Order::Tooltip`] and deliberately keep floating over an
//! open overlay, and remain interactive there.
//!
//! # The modal-layer claim, and the focus trap it sets
//!
//! Blocking *widgets* is not quite enough. egui also does area-level
//! hit-testing: [`egui::Area`] raises itself whenever the pointer is pressed
//! and `Memory::layer_id_at` names it. That query walks *area* rects, and an
//! overlay's area rect is only as big as its content: the full-viewport
//! backdrop is registered with [`egui::Ui::interact`], which senses a rect
//! without claiming layout space, or the card could not stay centred (an area
//! sized to the viewport has nothing left to centre within). So without help, a
//! press outside the card resolves to the window underneath and raises it above
//! the overlay: exactly the bug this design exists to fix.
//!
//! [`egui::Memory::set_modal_layer`] is what closes that gap. Its documented
//! job is confining keyboard focus, but `Memory::layer_id_at` also clamps its
//! answer to the modal layer, so a press over anything below the overlay is
//! attributed to the overlay and nothing beneath it ever asks to be raised.
//! The claim is therefore load-bearing for pointer layering, not a bonus.
//!
//! It comes with a trap. A claim takes effect the frame *after* it is made, so
//! on the frame an overlay closes, the previous frame's claim is still in
//! force. Widgets below the claimed layer are not "interested in focus", and
//! egui responds by actively surrendering their focus (see
//! `Context::create_widget`). An overlay that asks for the pre-dialog widget to
//! be focused again has it taken straight back, whenever that widget is drawn
//! *after* the overlay in the same frame. A trailing claim cannot be retracted,
//! and egui's only end-of-pass hook is a permanent plugin callback, so there is
//! nowhere to re-assert focus once per close. Overlays therefore restore it
//! twice: immediately, and again on the following frame via a pending flag.
//! The second attempt is the one that survives.
